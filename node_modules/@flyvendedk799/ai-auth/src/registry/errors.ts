/**
 * Turning a provider's failure into a sentence someone can act on.
 *
 * Everything that goes wrong out at the model arrives as an SDK error whose message is the
 * raw response body — `429 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"rate_limit_error","message":"Error"}}`
 * — and forwarding that to a browser verbatim is the default. It says what happened in the
 * protocol and nothing about what to do, which is the only part a person needs.
 *
 * The remedy also depends on *how the call was paid for*, which is why this takes a provider.
 * A 429 on a metered key means "you are sending too fast"; the same status on a subscription
 * means the plan's own allowance is used up — often by something else entirely, because a
 * plan is shared with every tool signed in to it, the `claude` CLI included. Those are
 * different problems with different fixes, and a single "rate limited" would send half the
 * people who see it to the wrong one.
 *
 * Kept as a pure function of (error, provider, model) so the mapping is testable without a
 * network, which matters: every branch here is a thing that only happens when something is
 * already going wrong, and those are exactly the paths nobody exercises by hand.
