/**
 * One account's Claude subscription, stored and kept fresh.
 *
 * The machine-local reader in `localCli.ts` deliberately never refreshes a live token: that
 * credential belongs to the `claude` CLI, and rotating its refresh token would break the CLI's
 * own session. This is the opposite case in every respect. The credential was minted *for*
 * this app by a login the user did here, no CLI is holding a second copy, and nothing else
 * will ever refresh it — so refreshing is not merely safe, it is the only thing keeping the
 * account connected past the first hour.
 *
 * Which means the rotated refresh token has to be written back. A refresh that returns a new
 * refresh token and drops it on the floor works exactly once and then logs the user out for
 * reasons nobody can reconstruct afterwards.
 *
 * Storage is an interface, not a table — see `store/types.ts`. What lands in it is sealed
 * first, so an adapter never holds a token in the clear and writing a new adapter involves no
 * decisions about cryptography.
